# API Product Page

This project is a responsive product page that dynamically fetches product data from an API, allowing users to add and remove items from the cart with real-time calculations. The interface includes smooth animations powered by Framer Motion and leverages local storage to preserve the cart state across sessions.

## Features

- **Add to Cart:** Users can add products to the cart with a single click.
- **Delete Cart Item:** Cart items can be removed easily, and the total amount is recalculated dynamically.
- **Dynamic Total Calculation:** The total cost in the cart is updated automatically based on the number of items.
- **API Data Fetching:** Product data is fetched from an external API ([DummyJSON](https://dummyjson.com)) to populate the product page.
- **Local Storage:** Cart data is saved in the browser's local storage, so the cart persists between sessions.
- **Responsive Design:** The layout is fully responsive, providing an optimal user experience across all devices.
- **Framer Motion Animations:** Smooth animations for product transitions, cart updates, and other UI interactions.
